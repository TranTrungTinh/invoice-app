# Data Visualization | The One

It uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/). The D3 modules most commonly used in data visualization are already installed.

It also includes a simple CSS reset, as existing Svelte templates sometimes have styles that break data visualizations. There is little else added, the template is meant to be barebones.
